# MATH-6397---Research-Firm-Coding-Exercise

Directions:
Research Firm Analysis.
Things to keep in mind. 
1.	Time constraint, typically they time allocation is 2 days before the interview or the weekend before the interview. 
2.	The expectation is that you should be able to provide analysis after (2) hours of work only. While this is unrealistic if you do everything from scratch, it is doable if you have a library for exploratory analysis that you are comfortable using. 
The challenge is to explain factors influencing “well_cost” using only the data present in the dataset.  There is no “right or final answer” to the exercise, just several interesting issues you can explore.  During the interview, you will present your findings and we will want to talk about and look at the work you did to get to them. 
You may use Python or R, and can use Jupyter notebooks, Excel, and PowerPoint to capture your work (data, code, visualizations) and share it with us during the interview.  Please email us any files you will want to use and we will put them on the laptop for you.  You may also bring your own laptop if that is what you prefer to present from. 
As you work with the data, imagine it has come from an analyst who compiles information on these wells as the data is made available publicly.  As part of the challenge, note any important problems you find within the data and either correct them yourself, suggest what might have caused the problem, or recommend that the analyst should go back and correct them.  You will need to figure out how to deal with these issues as part of your analysis of “well_cost”.
